The Hotreus62 Keyboard is a fork of [atreus62 keyboard](https://github.com/profet23/atreus62). It supports MX hotswap and Kailh Choc v1 hotswap sockets on the same board, similar to [Lily58 Pro](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58). The overall keyboard height is reduced, with the breakout board placing on the top.
