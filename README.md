# Hotreus62 Keyboard

![Hotreus62 Keyboard](docs/banner.jpg)

The Hotreus62 Keyboard is a fork of [atreus62 keyboard](https://github.com/profet23/atreus62). It supports MX hotswap and Kailh Choc v1 hotswap sockets on the same board, similar to [Lily58 Pro](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58). It's great for testing which type of keyswitches feels best for the keyboard. The overall keyboard height is reduced, with the breakout board placing on the top.

Pre-soldered keyboard PCBs / DIY kits are available at the [beekeeb shop](https://shop.beekeeb.com/?s=hotreus62&post_type=product).
